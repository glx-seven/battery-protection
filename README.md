# Battery protection PCB
A protection PCB for small LiPo cells, I did design it for use with cells extracted from these disposable vapes I had found a few laying around in the city I live.

It is designed to be a flex-PCB, also it can technically be cut down to use it with small square cells with the pads  on the back.

I have attached gerber files so you can order it at your favourite PCB-manufacturer, I did use JLCPCB's flex-PCBs and they came out nicely.

The N-FETs used are probably a litte oversized but I used them because I had them on hand and they have a low Vgs and low Rds(on). Feel free to use different/cheaper ones, that's why I uploades all the source files.
